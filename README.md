# Data Cleaning Steps Performed

1. Missing Values Handled:
- Filled missing values in `director`, `cast`, `country`, and `rating` with `'Not Available'`.
- Converted `date_added` to datetime format; handled missing dates with `NaT`.

2. Removed Duplicates:
- Used `drop_duplicates()` to clean the dataset.

3. Standardized Text:
- Converted string columns to lowercase and removed extra spaces.
- Cleaned and renamed column headers to lowercase with underscores.

4. Date Format Standardization:
- Used `pd.to_datetime()` to ensure all dates are in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

5. Corrected Data Types:
- Verified data types using `.info()`, especially for date and year columns.

# Output
- Cleaned dataset ready for analysis or modeling.
- Exported as `netflix_titles_cleaned.csv`.

# Learning Outcomes

- Understood key data preprocessing tasks using Pandas.
- Practiced handling missing values, duplicates, and standardizing formats.
- Built confidence to clean raw datasets independently.
